The calabash console allows you to interact with the application being tested. To create the step definition file, you first need to find out what Calabash queries you need to be able to run the tests. If part of the test requires you to touch a button, then you need to know what the button is called to write it into your test. The console will find all of the views on the screen, and you can **query**, **touch** and **interact** with the elements within the application.

The syntax for queries between iOS and Android is different, but both platforms can be tested using calabash.
