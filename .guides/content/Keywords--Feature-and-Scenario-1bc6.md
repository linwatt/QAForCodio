<h2>The Feature Preamble </h2> 
The word **Feature** is a *required* keyword which introduces a short description of the feature we are building. It describes *What* the feature is about and *Why* we want it. 

This is characteristic of very high-level requirements language: we are describing *What* we are doing and at the same time *Why* we are doing it. The statement is written in free-form text.

<h2>Scenarios</h2>
**Scenario**, another required keyword, is a example of *How* the user will interact with the system. Scenarios are examples that demonstrate the functionality we intend to build. This is the lower-lever of the requirement language. 
Scenarios are comprised of Steps in Gherkin format that utilizes one of five key words **Given, When, Then, And, But**.
