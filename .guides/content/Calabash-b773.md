<h2>What is Calabash?</h2>
**Calabash** is a automated testing tool that supports Android and iOS native apps.

Calabash supports **Cucumber** (an automated testing tool designed for website testing). Cucumber and Calabash let you express the behavior of the application by writing it in plain English format named *Gherkin*, which provides a bridge to code that implements that specification. (Gherkin is also used as the format in the Acceptance Criteria in User Stories.) 

Calabash also utilizes third-party libraries called gems to communicate and/or interact with the native Android and iOS operating systems.

Calabash has two distinct parts:
1) **Feature Files** -  *The What*
Where the plain English gherkin scenarios are written 
2) **Step_definition File** - *The How*
Where the code is written to exercise the gherkin statements in the feature files.
