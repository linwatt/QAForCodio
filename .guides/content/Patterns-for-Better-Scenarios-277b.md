1) **Essence Not Implementation** - Focus on the what: What the system is intended to do, in its own terms. **The essence is the what, not the how**

2) **Don't dial every Number** - Scenarios can be automated but they are not a comprehensive set of tests to be created far in advance of implementation. 
     - Use a few samples of tests, plus some important special cases. As with a phone you don't have to dial every number to confirm that the phone is working. 
   - Redundant scenarios slow down and hinder communication and understanding.

3) **Interesting First** - If the team understands the domain, start with something interesting: This is usually a non-obvious or controversial function/result. 
   - focusing on interesting cases has another benefit here: when reviewed with the team *you don't waste time on scenarios everybody already understands*.

4) **Simple to Complex** - If the domain is unfamiliar to the team, have the scenarios tell a story in growing complexity 
This approach provides the following benefits:
    - Helps others learn more easily,
    - Makes it easier to see whether you've covered everything you intend to
    - Exposes places where complex scenarios are unnecessary, or can wait until later.
